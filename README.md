The following commands will build and install the software:

   make

After running make, you may be prompted with an interface
asking you to run a configuration procedure (hotkey 'c')
and then generate a makefile (hotkey 'g').
This is for building the STINGER library which is downloaded
during the overall build process.

To run the benchmarks use the command:

	make bench

The benchmarks will take awhile to execute.

The results from the benchmarks are placed in the directory:

	graph_benchmarks/results

You can find pre-run results from a KNL machine at:

	graph_benchmarks/results/prerun_results
